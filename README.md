Hi, I’m Ankit Yadav — a passionate tech enthusiast from India, currently pursuing my BCA at the University of Lucknow. I have always been driven by a deep curiosity for technology and design.

I have 5 years of programming experience in Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Right now, I’m learning JavaScript, Java, React, and more. I’m especially interested in Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity, and love exploring how to build secure and scalable systems.

I'm also into UI/UX design and have over 3 years of experience with tools like Photoshop, Canva, Figma, and DaVinci Resolve — creating everything from logos and posters to videos and animations.

I love mixing creativity with technology — and I’m just getting started. Let’s learn and grow together!
